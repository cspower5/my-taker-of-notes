  Write and save notes organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

  1. Opening the Note Taker takes me to a landing page with a link to a notes page
  2. Click the link then I see a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, 
     plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
  3. When I enter a new note title and the note’s text a save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
  4. Click on the Save icon to add the new note I have which is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
  5. Click on an existing note in the list that note appears in the right-hand column
  6. Click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page then an empty field to enter a new note title and the note’s text appears in the right-hand column.
  7. Click on the delete icon and the note is removed from the page.
